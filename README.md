# Composite_Interphase_calculation_from_X-rayCT
This is the code for fitting gray scale distribution in X-ray CT data to differentiate ceramic/polymer and quantify interphase in composite.
Additionally, the present code also calcualte the domain size in both Ostu's method and using gaussian fitting to do recalcualtion.
